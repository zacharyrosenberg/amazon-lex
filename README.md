# amazon-lex

This program is a laguage translation bot using Amazon Lex. I provide the chatbot with user intent, utterances, and slots. Amazon Translate is used to convert the input text into the desired language. The program in this repository is the Lambda function that handles the user input and communicates with Amazon Translation and Amazon Lex to provide the desired output for the user.
